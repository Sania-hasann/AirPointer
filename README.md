# Hand-Gesture-Browser-Navigation
This project enables real-time browser control using hand gestures detected through your laptop's camera. Leveraging a CNN+LSTM model, it recognizes gestures like Palm, Fist, directional pointing right, left, up and down, and  to perform browser actions such as opening new tabs, closing tabs, refreshing pages, and switching between tabs.
